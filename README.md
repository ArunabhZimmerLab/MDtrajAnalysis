PDB Trajectory Lipid and Protein Interaction Analysis


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) designed for analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) PDB trajectories. It focuses on characterizing lipid membrane properties (phosphorus atom distributions, lipid Centers of Geometry) and quantifying protein-lipid interactions. The script is parallelized using Python's multiprocessing module for efficient processing of large trajectory files.


Features


Parallel PDB Parsing: Efficiently reads large PDB trajectory files by distributing the workload across multiple CPU cores.


It generates the following graphs:


1. 2D density heatmaps (X-Y, X-Z, Y-Z planes) of phosphorus atoms for each specified lipid type.

2. Lipid Center of Geometry (COG) Heatmaps in the X-Y plane (I assume that the simulation box has the lipid bilayer in this plane.

3. Protein É‘-Carbon (CA) Trace Overlay: Overlays the protein's alpha-carbon trace from the first model onto the first lipid's COG heatmap, to provide relative coordinates' context. A standalone CA trace plot is also generated if you wish to overlay them manually, although it may not be very helpful.

4. Protein-Lipid Interaction Frequencies: Quantifies the contact frequency between protein residues and specified lipid types based on a distance cutoff.

5. Running this on a large sim box with a lot of PDBs may take forever, so this also outputs the data used in the inidividual graphs as csv files, so that the user can plot them manually later.



The parameters for heatmap binning, interaction cutoff, and parallelization settings are easy to modify, and you can find and tweak them in the second part of the script.

I have also included an optional "test mode" for quickly running the analysis on a subset of frames for debugging or previewing results.


Credits: Google gemini, for modifying the script to parallelize it on multiple cores, and overcome RAM issues by conditionally splitting data based on hardware.


Requirements


Python 3.x

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn

How to Use


Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/ArunabhZimmerLab/MDtrajAnalysis.git

cd MDtrajAnalysis

Place your .pdb trajectory file (e.g., EMT_t5.pdb) in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook, or provide its full path.

You can alternatively run this on Google colab, although I have not run it there yet, so I don't know if it can parse really large files. I tested it on a 41GB PDB trajectory on my local system, with 16cores and 32 GB DDR4 RAM, and it took 20 minutes to run fully.

Provide Inputs when Prompted:


The notebook will prompt you to enter the path to your PDB trajectory file.


Example:


EMT_t5.pdb (if in the same directory) or /path/to/your/EMT_t5.pdb

It will then prompt you to enter the lipid residue IDs you wish to analyze, separated by spaces.

Example: POPG POPE PMCL or PMPC POPC CHOL


Output


The script will generate several plots (saved as .png files) and corresponding data files (saved as .csv files) in a newly created csv_data directory.


Generated Files:


Heatmaps:


heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_COG_XY_*.png: 2D density heatmap of lipid COGs (X-Y plane). The first lipid's heatmap will also include an overlay of the protein's CA trace.

heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_P_atom_XY/XZ/YZ_*.png: 2D density heatmaps of phosphorus atoms for each lipid (X-Y, X-Z, and Y-Z planes).


CA Trace:


plot_ca_trace_xy_only_transparent_*.png: A standalone plot of the protein's alpha-carbon trace.


Interaction Frequencies:


interaction_frequency_{LIPID_ID}_chain_{CHAIN_ID}_*.png: Plots showing the contact frequency of each specified lipid with protein residues per chain.


CSV Data Files (in csv_data directory):


heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_COG_XY_density_*.csv: Raw density data for lipid COG heatmaps.

heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_COG_XY_x_edges_*.csv: X-axis bin edges for lipid COG heatmaps.

heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_COG_XY_y_edges_*.csv: Y-axis bin edges for lipid COG heatmaps.

heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_P_atom_XY/XZ/YZ_density_*.csv: Raw density data for phosphorus atom heatmaps.

heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_P_atom_XY/XZ/YZ_x_edges_*.csv: X-axis bin edges for phosphorus atom heatmaps.

heatmap_{LIPID_ID}_P_atom_XY/XZ/YZ_y_edges_*.csv: Y-axis bin edges for phosphorus atom heatmaps.


ca_trace_model1_chain_{CHAIN_ID}_coords_*.csv: X, Y, Z coordinates of alpha-carbon atoms for each protein chain in Model 1.

interaction_frequency_{LIPID_ID}_chain_{CHAIN_ID}_*.csv: Residue number and corresponding contact frequency for protein-lipid interactions.

(Note: * in filenames will be replaced by _full_data if running on all frames, or _first_{MAX_TEST_FRAMES}_frames_per_chunk if TEST_MODE_ENABLED is True.)


Configuration Parameters


You can modify the following parameters in the first code cell of the notebook:

num_heatmap_bins: Number of bins for the 2D histograms (heatmaps). Higher values mean finer resolution but more computation.

interaction_cutoff: Distance (in Angstroms) used to define a contact between a protein atom and a lipid phosphorus atom.

NUM_CORES: Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. Defaults to your system's available cores.

TEST_MODE_ENABLED: Set to True to process only a subset of frames for quick testing.

MAX_TEST_FRAMES: The number of frames to process per worker in TEST_MODE_ENABLED.

Protein_chains_to_monitor: A set of chain IDs that correspond to your protein(s).

non_protein_resnames_base: A base list of residue names to exclude when identifying protein atoms (e.g., water, ions). The user-specified lipids are dynamically removed from this list to ensure they are treated as lipids, not non-protein.
